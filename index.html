            	"Quite impossible, as you see, to start without an introduction," laughed Ivan. "Well, then, I mean to place the event described in the poem in the sixteenth century, an age—as you must have been told at school—when it was the great fashion among poets to make the denizens and powers of higher worlds descend on earth and mix freely with mortals... In France all the notaries' clerks, and the monks in the cloisters as well, used to give grand performances, dramatic plays in which long scenes were enacted by the Madonna, the angels, the saints, Christ, and even by God Himself. In those days, everything was very artless and primitive. An instance of it may be found in Victor Hugo's drama, Notre Dame de Paris, where, at the Municipal Hall, a play called Le Bon Jugement de la Tres-sainte et Gracièuse Vierge Marie, is enacted in honour of Louis XI, in which the Virgin appears personally to pronounce her 'good judgment.' In Moscow, during the prepetrean period, performances of nearly the same character, chosen especially from the Old Testament, were also in great favour. Apart from such plays, the world was overflooded with mystical writings, 'verses'—the heroes of which were always selected from the ranks of angels, saints and other heavenly citizens answering to the devotional purposes of the age. The recluses of our monasteries, like the Roman Catholic monks, passed their time in translating, copying, and even producing original compositions upon such subjects, and that, remember, during the Tarter period!... In this connection, I am reminded of a poem compiled in a convent—a translation from the Greek, of course—called, 'The Travels of the Mother of God among the Damned,' with fitting illustrations and a boldness of conception inferior nowise to that of Dante. The 'Mother of God' visits hell, in company with the archangel Michael as her cicerone to guide her through the legions of the 'damned.' She sees them all, and is witness to their multifarious tortures. Among the many other exceedingly remarkably varieties of torments—every category of sinners having its own—there is one especially worthy of notice, namely a class of the 'damned' sentenced to gradually sink in a burning lake of brimstone and fire. Those whose sins cause them to sink so low that they no longer can rise to the surface are for ever forgotten by God, i.e., they fade out from the omniscient memory, says the poem—an expression, by the way, of an extraordinary profundity of thought, when closely analysed. The Virgin is terribly shocked, and falling down upon her knees in tears before the throne of God, begs that all she has seen in hell—all, all without exception, should have their sentences remitted to them. Her dialogue with God is colossally interesting.

            <p id="mtIntro">In the midst of routine, I realized that my bus commute to work/school consisted of a generally fixed length of time. I had tried several book based apps from the App Store which segmented and gamified the reading process, but I noticed that there wasn't a single one that could curate text based off my schedule rather than their own. I decided to develop a native iOS application that can break down a novel based upon your personal reading speed and the length of time you have to dedicate to reading. </p>

I saw this as an opportunity to create a smooth-flowing on-boarding segment which could deliver the necessary information, but in a genuine, non-jarring way. I used an iOS framework called Paper-onboarding to help me achieve this.

            <!-- <p id="dProcess">With makeTime being my first non-hybrid App, the development process was surprisingly enjoyable and intuitive. Coded entirely in Swift from the ground--up, excluding the assistance of an animation Framework(Paper-onboarding).</p>
                                    Considering that the application requires the user's particaption prior to its usability, an on-boarding segment was created. I used this section to minimize cognative load on entry as well as frame the initial flow of the app. To avoid immediate loss of interest, each on-boarding slide was made short, but informative along with the inclusion of charming illustrations (artwork by Hannah Goerner) and smooth/appealing page transitions via the paper-onboarding framework.
            <p id="dProcess2"></p>

            <p id="dProcess3">In order to provide a properly sized segment of text, the application would need to guage and save the user's individual reading speed. To do this, I created an initial test requiring the user to read through approximatly three minutes of content while a timer function ran secretly in the background--starting when the user hit begin, and stopping once the final page had been tapped/turned. Using the reading time value along with a word count of the content, I used an algorithm to return the user's words read per minute.</p>
            
            <p id="dProcess4">Once the test is finished, the reading speed is displayed, and the user is prompted to create a reading schedule (a time of day, and the length of time per reading session). With a words-per-minute value, and a time value, any book can be broken down and segmented accordingly. Storing the books in a property list,I can cut the exact amount of words out and display them. To avoid providing the user with the same segment of words each day, the book in the property list is edited, and the words already read are removed.</p> -->

        <!-- <p id="onBoardingTitle">Take Away</p>
        <p id="onBoardingSubTitle">In creating this project I've gained experience in connecting/instantiating different view controllers, accessing, altering and storing data via property lists. Along with hours of practice with Swift's storyboard based front-end development. 
            
        If I was to revisit this project, I would store the book data in an external database, and provide a user with a way of back-tracking and reexperiencing content that they've already read. I would also like to gamify the whole process via achievments for progress and application interaction, by doing this, I believe that the user would be more inclinded to finish the book they've started as well as increasing app usage.
